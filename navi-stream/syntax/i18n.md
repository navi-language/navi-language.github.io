# I18n

Navi support to define I18n strings.

Use `@` and follow by a identifier to define a I18n string.

The following statement defines the I18n string `hello`, which supports two languages: `zh-CN` and `en`.

```nvs
@hello {
    "en" = "Hello",
    "zh-CN" = "你好"
}
```

Yes, we can also use string interpolation to define I18n strings:

```nvs
let n = 10;

@length {
    "en" = `Length {n}`,
    "zh-CN" = `长度 {n}`
}
```

You can use `@<identifier>` to reference I18n string with current locale.

For example, the following code assigns `Hello` or `你好` to the variable `value` when the closing price is greater than the opening price, otherwise it is an empty string.

```nvs
@hello {
  "en" = "Hello",
  "zh-CN" = "你好",
}

let value = quote.close > quote.open ? @hello : "";
```

::: warning
The string interpolation in I18n string definition is relative to the statement where the definition is referenced.
:::

For example, the following code assigns `Length 10` or `长度 10` to the variable `a`, and `Length 20` or `长度 20` to the variable `b`.

```nvs
@length {
  "en" = `Length {n}`,
  "zh-CN" = `长度 {n}`,
}

let n = 10;
let a = @length;
// a = "Length 10"

n = 20;
let b = @length;
// b = "Length 20"
```

Result:

```nvs
{
  "a": "Length 10",
  "b": "Length 20"
}
```
