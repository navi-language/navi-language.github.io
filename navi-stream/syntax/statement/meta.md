# Meta

`meta` use for define the metadata of this Navi Stream. It just like a doc of this script.

When the script is compiled, you can get the original array value of the specified name from `Instance`, which is usually used to attach some description information to the metric.

## Syntax

```nvs
meta {
    title = "MACD indicator",
    description = "MACD is a trend-following indicator that consists of three lines, namely the fast line, the slow line and the bar line."
    author = "Navi Team"
}
```
