# strategy

## METADATA: initial_cash

`initial_cash: number`

Initial cash.

Default is `100000`.

## METADATA: pyramiding

`pyramiding: number`

The maximum number of entries allowed in the same direction. If the value is 0, only one entry order in the same direction can be opened, and additional entry orders are rejected.

Default is `0`.

## METADATA: allow_entry_in

`allow_entry_in: direction`

Used to specify in which market direction the `strategy.entry` function is allowed to open positions. Possible values: `direction.long`, `direction.short`, `nil`.

Default is `nil`.

## METADATA: commission

`commission: string`

Commission for each transaction.

The format is `type=value`, where `type` is one of `percent`, `fixed`, `cash-per-contract`.

You can use multiple commissions by separating them with a comma (e.g., `percent=0.1,fixed=10`).

Default is ``.

## METADATA: initial_margin_long

Margin rate for initial short positions.

Default is `1.0`.

## METADATA: initial_margin_short

Margin rate for initial short positions.

Default is `1.0`.

## METADATA: maintenance_margin_long

Margin rate for maintenance long positions.

Default is `1.0`.

## METADATA: maintenance_margin_short

Margin rate for maintenance short positions.

Default is `1.0`.

## METADATA: slippage

`slippage: number`

Slippage for each transaction.

Default is `0`.

## METADATA: risk_free_rate

`risk_free_rate: number`

Risk-free rate of return is the annual percentage change in the value of an investment with minimal or zero risk. It is used to calculate the [Sharpe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio) and [Sortino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortino_ratio) ratios.

Default is `0.02`.

## entry

`entry(id: string, side: direction, qty: number = nil, qty_percent: number = nil, price: number = nil, remark: string = nil)`

Creates a new order to open or add to a position.

If the call does not contain `price` argument, it creates a market order, otherwise, it creates a limit order.

Orders from this command, unlike those from `strategy.order`, are affected by the `pyramiding` parameter. Pyramiding specifies the number of concurrent open entries allowed per position. For example, with `pyramiding = 3`, the strategy can have up to three open trades, and the command cannot create orders to open additional trades until at least one existing trade closes.

When a strategy executes an order from this command in the opposite direction of the current market position, it reverses that position. For example, if there is an open long position of five shares, an order from this command with a `quantity` of 5 and a direction of `direction.short` triggers the sale of 10 shares to close the long position and open a new five-share short position.
Users can change this behavior by specifying an allowed direction with the `METADATA: allow_entry_in`.

## order

`order(id: string, side: direction, qty: number = nil, qty_percent: number = nil, price: number = nil, remark: string = nil)`

Creates a new order to open, add to, or exit from a position.

If the call does not contain `price` argument, it creates a market order, otherwise, it creates a limit order.

Orders from this command, unlike those from `strategy.entry`, are not affected by the `pyramiding` parameter. Strategies can open any number of trades in the same direction with calls to this function.

This command does not automatically reverse open positions because it does not exclusively create entry orders like `strategy.entry` does. For example, if there is an open long position of five shares, an order from this command with a `quantity` of 5 and a direction of `direction.short` triggers the sale of five shares, which closes the position.

## close

`close(id: string, qty: number = nil, qty_percent: number = nil, remark: string = nil)`

Creates an order to exit from the part of a position opened by entry orders with a specific identifier. If multiple entries in the position share the same ID, the orders from this command apply to all those entries, starting from the first open trade, when its calls use that ID as the id argument.

This command always generates market orders.

## cancel

`cancel(id: string)`

Cancels a pending or unfilled order with a specific identifier. If multiple unfilled orders share the same ID, calling this command with that ID as the id argument cancels all of them. If a script calls this command with an id representing the ID of a filled order, it has no effect.

## cancel_all

`cancel_all()`

Cancels all pending or unfilled orders, regardless of their identifiers.

This command is most useful when working with price-based orders (e.g., limit orders).
